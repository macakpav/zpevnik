[Hmi]I know the[G]re's something in the [A]wake of your [Hmi]smile
I get a [G]notion from the [A]look in your [Hmi]eyes yea
you've built a [G]love but that [A]love falls a[Hmi]part
your little piece of heaven [G]turns too [Emi]dark

Listen to your [Hmi]heart
[G]when he's [D]calling for [A]you
Listen to your [Hmi]heart
[G]there's nothing [D]else you can [A]do
I don't [D]know where you're [A]going
and [G]I don't know [D]why
but listen to your [Hmi]heart
[G]befo[A]re you tell him good[Hmi]bye

[Hmi G A Hmi] [Hmi G A Hmi]

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide yea
They're swept away and nothing is what it seems
the feeling of belonging to your dreams

Listen to your heart...

[Hmi G A Hmi] [Hmi G A Hmi] [D A G D] [Hmi G A]

[E]And there are voices that want to be heard
[C#mi]So much to mention but you can't find the words
[H]The scent of magic the [A]beauty that's been
[H]when love was wilder [C#]than the wind

Listen to your [D#mi]heart
[H]when he's [F#]calling for [C#]you
Listen to your [D#mi]heart
[H]there's nothing [F#]else you can [C#]do
I don't [F#]know where you're [C#]going
and [H]I don't know [F#]why
but listen to your [D#mi]heart
[H]befo[C#]re you tell him good[D#mi]bye

Listen to your [D#mi]heart...
