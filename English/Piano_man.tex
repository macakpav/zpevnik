It's [C]nine o[G]'clock on a [F C]saturday
The [F]regular [C]crowd shuffles [D7(C) G]in
There's an old man sitting next to me
making love to his tonic and gin

He says: Son can you play me a memory
I'm not really sure how it goes
But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
when I wore a younger mans clothes

R:
[Am]La la la de de [D7]da da 
[Am]La la, di di [D7]da da [G F C G7]dum

Sing us a song you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
and you've got us feeling all right

Now John at the bar he's a friend of mine,
he gets me my drinks for free
And he's quick with a joke and a light up your smoke
but there's some place that he'd rather be

He says: Bill I believe this is killing me
as the smile ran away from his face
Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
if I could get out of this place

R

Now Paul is a real estate novelist
who never had time for a wife
And he's talking with Davy
who's still in the Navy
and probably will be for life

And the waitress is practising politics
As the businessmen slowly get stoned
Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
but it's better than drinking alone

R

It's a pretty good crowd for a saturday
And the manager gives me a smile
Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
To forget about life for a while

And the piano sounds like a carnival
and the microphone smells like a beer
And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
and say: Man, what are you doing here?
