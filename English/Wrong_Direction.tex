Capo - Fifth Fret

[F C G Am ]

                                           
[F]When i was a kid the things i did were hidden [C]under the grid
Young and [G]naive, i never believed that love could b[Am]e so well hid
With reg[F]ret I'm willing to bet they say 'the o[C]lder you get           
It gets har[G]der to forgive and harder t[Am]o forget                         
It g[F]ets under your shirt like a da[C]gger at work                               
The f[G]irst cut is the deepest but the r[Am]est still flippin' hurt                           
You bu[F]ild your heart of plastic, you're c[C]ynical and sarcastic
and you e[G]nd up in the corner on your own

                                     
[F]'Cos I'd love to feel love, but i can't [C]stand the rejection
[G]I hide behind my jokes as a [Am]form of protection
[F]I thought i was close, but under [C]further inspection
[G]It seems I've been running, in the [Am]wrong direction, oh no

What's the p[F]oint in getting your hopes up, when all you're ever getting is ch[C]oked up?
When you're co[G]ked up, and can't remember the re[Am]ason why you broke up
You'll [F]call her in the morning when you're [C]coming down and falling
Like an [G]old man on the side of the road

[F]When you're apart, you don't wanna mingle
[C]When you're together you wanna be single                             
[G]Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss that [Am]made your heart tingle
[F]How much greener the grass is
[C]Through those rose tinted glasses
[G]And the butterflies that flutter by and leave us on our arses

[F]'Cos I'd love to feel love, but i can't [C]stand the rejection
[G]I hide behind my jokes as a [Am]form of protection
[F]I thought i was close, but under [C]further inspection
[G]It seems I've been running, in the [Am]wrong direction
                       
[F]There's fish in the sea for me to m[C]ake a selection
[G]I'd jump in, if it wasn't for my [Am]ear infection
[F]All I really want is just to [C]make a connection
[G]But it seems I've been running in the [Am]wrong direction, oh no

[F C G Am x2]
