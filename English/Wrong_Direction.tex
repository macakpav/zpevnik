When i was a kid the things i did were hidden under the grid
Young and naive, i never believed that love could be so well hid
With regret I'm willing to bet they say 'the older you get           
It gets harder to forgive and harder to forget                         
It gets under your shirt like a dagger at work                               
The first cut is the deepest but the rest still flippin' hurt                           
You build your heart of plastic, you're cynical and sarcastic
and you end up in the corner on your own

                                     
'Cos I'd love to feel love, but i can't stand the rejection
I hide behind my jokes as a form of protection
I thought i was close, but under further inspection
It seems I've been running, in the wrong direction, oh no

What's the point in getting your hopes up, when all you're ever getting is choked up?
When you're coked up, and can't remember the reason why you broke up
You'll call her in the morning when you're coming down and falling
Like an old man on the side of the road

When you're apart, you don't wanna mingle
When you're together you wanna be single                             
Ever the chase to taste the kiss of bliss that made your heart tingle
How much greener the grass is
Through those rose tinted glasses
And the butterflies that flutter by and leave us on our arses

'Cos I'd love ...
                       
There's fish in the sea for me to make a selection
I'd jump in, if it wasn't for my ear infection
All I really want is just to make a connection
But it seems I've been running in the wrong direction, oh no
