1.[Hm]Hello
Is there anybody [A]in there ?
Just [G]nod if you can [Em]hear me
Is there [Hm]anyone at home ?

2.Come on now
I hear your feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again

3.Relax
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

R: [D]There is no pain you are re[A]ceding
[D]A distant ship smoke on the ho[A]rizon
[C]You are only coming through in [G]waves
[C]Your lips move but I can't hear what you're [G]saying
When [D]I was a child I had a [A]fever
My [D]hands felt just like two ball[A]oons
[C]Now I've got that feeling once [G]again
I can't explain, you would not [C]understand
This is not how I [G]am
[A] I [C] have be[G]come comfortably [D]numb

Solo:
[D,A,D,A,C,G,C,G]

[A] I [C] have be[G]come comfortably [D]numb

4. O.K.
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
But you may feel a little sick

5. Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on it's time to go.

R: There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone

And[A] I [C] have be[G]come comfortably [D]numb.
