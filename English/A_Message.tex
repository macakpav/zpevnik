[C] My song is l[Am G]ove
[C] Love to the l[Am]oveless sh[G (F)]own
[C]And it goes [Am G]on
You don't [Dm]have to [C]be alo[G]ne


Your heavy heart
Is made of stone
And it's so hard to see, clearly
You don't have to be on your own
You don't have to be on your own


[Dm]And I'm not gonna t[C]ake it b[G]ack
[Dm]And I'm not gonna say I d[C]on't mean t[G]hat
[Dm]You're the target that I'm a[C]iming a[G]t
And I'll g[F]et that m[C]essage ho[G]me


My song is love
My song is love, unknown
But I'm on fire for you, clearly
You don't have to be alone
You don't have to be on your own


And I'm not gonna take it back
And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that
You're the target that I'm aiming at
But I'm nothing on my own
Got to get that message home


[Dm C G 2x]


And I'm not gonna stand and wait
Not gonna leave it until it's much too late
On a platform I'm gonna stand and say
That I'm nothing on my own
That I love you, please come home


[F C G Am]


My [F]song is l[C]ove, is l[G]ove un[Am]known
And I've [F]got to g[C]et that m[G]essage [C]home
