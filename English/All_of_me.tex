[Em]What would I [C]do without your smart [G]mouth
Drawing me [D]in, and kicking me [Em]out
Got my head spinning, no kidding, 
I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
Im on your magical mystery ride
And Im so dizzy, dont know what hit me, 
but I'll be alright

B: [Am]My heads under [G]water, but [D]I'm breathing [Am]fine
You're crazy and [G]I'm out of my mi[D]nd

R: Cause [G]all of me, loves [Em]all of you
Love your cu[Am]rves and all your edges
All your pe[D]rfect imperfections
Give your [G]all to me
I'll give my [Em]all to you
Youre my [Am]end and my beginning
Even [D]when I lose I'm winning
Cause I give you [Em C]all, all of [G]me
And you give me [Em C]all, all of [G]you, [D]oh
\columnbreak
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when youre crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every move
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

B: My heads under water...

Ref: Cause all of me...

Give me all of [Am]you, oh, cards on the [G]table
We're bo[D]th showing hea[Am]rts
Risking it [G]all, though it's ha[D]rd


Ref: Cause all of me...

Cause I give you all, all of me
And you give me all, all of you, oh
