[Em]Today is [G]gonna be the day
that they're [D]gonna throw it back to [A7]you
By now you should've somehow
realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
feels the way I do about you [C D A]now

Backbeat the word was on the street
that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody
feels the way I do about you now

B:And [C]all the roads we [D]have to walk are [Em]winding
And [C]all the lights that [D]lead us there are [Em]blinding
There [C]are many [D]things that I would [G]like [G/F# Em]to say to you
but I don't know [A7]how

R:Cause [C Em G]maybe you're gonna be the one that
saves me and after all
you're my wonderwall
