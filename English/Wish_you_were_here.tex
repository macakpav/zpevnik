[C]So, so you think you can [D]tell,
Heaven from [Am]Hell, blue skys from [G]pain.
Can you tell a green [D]field from a cold steel [C]rail, a smile from a [Am]veil,
Do you think you can [G]tell?

And did they get you to [C]trade your heroes for [D]ghosts,
Hot ashes for [Am]trees, hot air for a cool [G]breeze, cold comfort for [D]change, 
And did you ex[C]change a walk on part in the [Am]war 
for a lead role in a  [G]cage?

[Em, G, Em, G, Em, A, Em, A]

[C]How I wish, how I wish you were [D]here.
We're just [Am]two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, [G]year after year,
[D]Running over the same old ground. What [C]have we found?
The same old [Am]fears. Wish you were [G]here!

[Em, G, Em, G, Em, A, Em, A, G]
